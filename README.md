# Code for Bhasin et al.

Simulations are broken into three Jupyter notebooks:
- `simulations_heterosynaptic.ipynb`: consolidation in our circuit model with the heterosynaptic rule at the late-learning site (Figs. 1c, 2, 3a)
- `simulations_hebbian.ipynb`: consolidation with the Hebbian rule at the late-learning site (Fig. 1d)
- `simulations_neural_integrator.ipynb`: simple example neural integrator circuit (Fig. 3b)
